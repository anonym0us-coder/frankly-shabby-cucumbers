    <h1>Frankly Shabby Cucumbers</h1>
    <p>The epic tale of the War of Cucumbers and the rise of the Frankly Shabbies</p>
</header>

<section>
    <h2>How It All Began</h2>
    <p>The War of Cucumbers began in the year 1629, when tensions first arose between the factions: Smooths, Bumps and 50/50. These factions were the pinacle of society, where every action undertaken was controlled by the SCO (Senior Cucumber Organisation).</p>
    <p>At the beginning, war was not considered an option for the strong bonds the teams had made with each other. However, as time passed, nature took its course and the 50/50 began to disturbe the silence</p>

    <h2>The War Unfolds</h2>
    <p>Among the 50/50 lied a clan called the Beit Alphas. These were notorious for their talent to identify imperfections and attack them. Within a matter of days the 50/50 left their home town to avenge clans of the other factions.</p>
    <p>The first to confront the Beit Alphas were the Schlumbergerites (members of the Smooths). Although they used all of their man power, it was no match for the sheer skill which the Beits posessed and naturally, became extinct within the matter of a few days.</p>
    <p>Among the commotion fleed the remaining Schlumbergerites to alert the rest of the cucumbers and the SCO. Unfortunately, by then, it was too late as the Beit Alphas had already taken control of over half of the Smooths.</p>

    <h2>A Cry For Help</h2>
    <p>A serious need for proper cucumber stability was needed due to the killing nature of the Beit Alphas. For this reason, the SCO released planned attacks on Beit Alphas home city and cut its connection from the 50/50 in hopes of scaring it.</p>
    <p>Unfortunately, this caused nothing, as most of the population had already migrated to the Smooths with no intent of returning its land back. This is when the SCO realised that more of an effort was required to eliminate the Beit Alphas...</p>

    <h2>The Rise Of The Rogues</h2>
    <p>The rogues were a nefarious select of clans known for being nomads to the original factions. Within them lied The Austin 95ers, The Frankly Shabbies and The Krowns. These clans were a select few of the rogues which had fighting skills which no other clans could match.</p>
    <p>The SCO knew it was their only chance, so they offered great sums of land to any rogue clan(s) which could outperform the Beit Alphas. Among those to accept the offers laid the clans previously mentioned.</p>
    <p>However, many of these rogues were outnumbered by the vast scale of troops the Beit Alphas had formed. Some of these fallen clans included: Sollasina Cthulhu and Ophiocistioids.</p>
    <p>The first big rogue clan to attack them was the Austin 95ers and legends say they were among the closest to victory. The Austins were equipped with a sense of spacial awareness greater than any other clan which really set the Beit Alphas on edge.</p>
    <p>But, just like the other clans, their efforts weren't enough. Matter of fact, they only killed a mere 5% of the Beit Alpha's population but some speculate that the reason for such small number was a lack of coordination.</p>
</section>

<section>
    <h2>Here Comes The Saviour, Right?</h2>
    <p>The year was now 1758 and there had lived entire generations believing that the Smooths were just a myth. Hope was really falling since now that the Beit Alphas practically controlled the Smooths, their next target was to reclaim their old land from the 50/50 faction.</p>
    <p>To make matters worse, the SCO had now dissolved as failure to form a viable plan of action had torn them apart. This was when a hero was needed, but more than just a person, an entire clan possible of completing the impossible.</p>
    <p>Along came the Frankly Shabbies to the doorstep of the Beit Alphas and resigned themselves, they were ready to be under new name. Bare in mind that the Frankly Shabbies was more than just a small clan. Their population made up for almost the entirity of the remaining Smooths.</p>
    <p>However, as they were let in to the gates of the Beit Alphas, this is where their plan was about to be executed. Although being outnumbered 1 : 5, their skill was out of the world. So, each of them pealers in hand, began to attack the "invincible" structure that the Beit Alphas had created.</p>

    <h2>Franklys' Flawless Flanking</h2>
    <p>The Frankly Shabbies executed their plan perfectly: inner Trojan attacks combined with a outer DDoS on the outer defences. At the start, their plan wasn't so great because of the sheer size of the Beit Alphas, but over the months, the Beit Alphas fell on their knees.</p>
    <p>The Beit Alphas ultimately crumbled into small pieces as they got cornered left, right and center. They ended up surrendering 1 year later when they were reduced to nothing. This was ultimately the rise and fall of such a powerful clan due to its lack of defences.</p>
    <p>For their bravery, the Franky Shabbies were awarded the promised land and alongside that, could restore the SCO to its original state.</p>
